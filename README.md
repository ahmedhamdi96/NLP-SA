*Natural Language Processing-Sentiment Analysis*

## Project Overview
*GUC, Winter 2018, CSEN1076*

The purpose of this project was to build a classifier for sentiment analysis from tweets, by learning from previously classified tweets. The task was to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative) of the text. The model was trained on existing data. The resulting model determines the class (neutral, positive, negative) of new texts (test data that were not used to build the model) with good accuracy.
